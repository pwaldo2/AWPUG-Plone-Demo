AWPUG-Plone-Demo
================

Demo to AWPUG at the Capital Factory, Austin, TX - Thursday, June 26, 2014

To get started, it is a good idea to make your virtual environment first rather than using your system Python.  For Plone 4.2+ use Python 2.7.

Example with virtualenvwrapper on Mac OS X

$ mkvirtualenv awpugpy
$ workon awpugpy
$ cd AWPUG-Plone-Demo
$ python bootstrap.py
$ ./bin/builoud

...get some coffee

$ ./bin/instance fg
