AWPUG-Plone-Demo
================

Demo to AWPUG at the Capital Factory, Austin, TX - Thursday, June 26, 2014

Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/waldopat/20140626-awpugplonely-in-austin-36490884

To get started, it is a good idea to make your virtual environment first rather than using your system Python.  For Plone 4.2+ use Python 2.7.

Example with virtualenvwrapper on Mac OS X

$ mkvirtualenv awpugpy

$ workon awpugpy

$ cd AWPUG-Plone-Demo

$ python bootstrap.py

$ ./bin/builoud

...get some coffee

$ ./bin/instance fg

In a browser go to http://localhost:8080

It will ask you to create a Plone site.  

Have fun!
